Here created an subscriber and publisher interaction code where both joestar and joelene are  the publisher and subscriber  who are publishing data so we are using rospy.publisher to publish data as a queue and when we are using rospy.subscriber we are calling information from the other publisher and calling them at an interval of 10 sec so our pc doenst crash.
